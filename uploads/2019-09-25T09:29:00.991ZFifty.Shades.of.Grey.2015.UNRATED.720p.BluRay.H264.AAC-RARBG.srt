2
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,540
Ana, take my car.

3
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,550
I gave you the recorder right?

4
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,110
- Oh, yes.
- And you have all the questions?

5
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,710
- Yes.
- And you know where you're going?

6
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,340
Yes, I do have a GPS, and a four point GPA.

7
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,010
- I can figure it out.
- You're wearing that?

8
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,420
Okay, a little less talking, more eating.

9
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,390
Miss Kavanagh?

10
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,720
- May I take your coat?
- Oh, yes.

11
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,820
Uh... She's... Okay.

12
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,670
- Mr Grey will see you now - Okay.

13
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,450
- This way please.
- Okay.

14
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,830
Mr Grey is in a conference at 11:15.

15
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,630
Right this way.

16
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,860
Miss Kavanagh, are you alright?

17
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,700
Christian Grey.

18
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,390
I'm Anastasia Steele.

19
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,130
Miss Kavanagh has the flu, so she asked me to fill in.

20
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,090
I see, so you're studying journalism as well?

21
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,210
No. English literature. Kate's my roommate.

22
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,440
As I said, I only have 10 minutes.

23
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,280
Please, have a seat Miss Steele.

24
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,060
Thanks.

25
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,460
- Ready?
- Whenever you are.

26
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,850
Okay.

27
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
So this is for the special graduation issue

28
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,870
of the student newspaper.

29
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,290
Yes, I'm giving the commencement address

30
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,810
at this year's ceremony.

31
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,040
You are?

32
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,770
I mean um... I know.

33
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,460
You are very young to have amassed such empire.

34
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,810
- To what do you owe...
- To what do I owe my success?

35
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,660
- Yep.
- Seriously?

36
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,030
Yes.

37
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,310
Business is about people, and I've always been good at people.

38
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,760
What motivates them, what incentivizes them, what inspires them.

39
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,640
Well, maybe you're just lucky.

40
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,670
I've always found, the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.

41
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,960
The key to my success is identifying talents in individuals.

42
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,220
- And harnessing their efforts.
- You're a control freak?

43
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,950
Oh, I exercise control in all things, Miss Steele.

44
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,990
Okay... um, your company is involved primarily

45
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,950
in the telecommunications sector.

46
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,040
Yet you also invest in numerous agricultural projects.

47
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,180
Including several in Africa. Is that something you feel passionate about?

48
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,040
Feeding the world's poor?

49
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,620
Its smart business.

50
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,210
You don't agree?

51
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,960
I don't know enough about it.

52
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,200
I just wonder, perhaps your heart might be a bit bigger than you want to let on?

53
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,490
But some people say I don't have a heart.

54
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,620
- Why would they say that?
- Because they know me well.

55
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,450
Continue.

56
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,340
Do you have any interests outside of work?

57
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,040
I enjoy various physical pursuits.

58
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,470
You're unmarried, oh, you were adopted at age four.

59
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,060
That's a matter of public record.

60
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,300
I'm sorry, I didn't...

61
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,840
Do you have an actual question, Miss Steele?

62
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,880
Yes, sorry.

63
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,980
Are you gay?

64
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,930
Its written here, I'm just...

65
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,510
No, Anastasia. I'm not gay.

66
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,700
I apologise, Mr Grey. Kate can be a little...

67
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,080
- Intrusive?
- Curious.

68
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,950
What about you?

69
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,780
Why don't you ask me something you wanna know?

70
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,880
Earlier you said that there are some people who know you well.

71
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,630
Why do I have the feeling that that is not true?

72
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,180
Mr Grey, your next meeting is in the conference room.

73
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,140
Cancel it please, we're not finished here.

74
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,360
Yes sir.

75
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,300
No, I um... I can go.

76
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,350
- Its fine.
- I would like to know more about you.

77
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,630
There's not really much to know about me.

78
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,480
You said you're in English literature?

79
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,350
Tell me, was it Charlotte Bront?, Jane Austen

80
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,190
or Thomas Hardy, who made you fall in love with literature?

81
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,020
Hardy.

82
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,330
I would've guessed Jane Austen.

83
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,010
What are your plans for after you graduate?

84
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,210
I'm just trying to get through my finals.

85
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,070
- And then?
- Then I was planning on moving here.

86
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,270
To Seattle with Kate.

87
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,700
We offer an excellent internship program.

88
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,580
I don't think I'd fit in here.

89
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,110
- Look at me.
- I am.

90
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,970
Mr Grey's office.

91
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,610
I hope you got everything you needed.

92
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,790
I think you only answered four questions.

93
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,050
- Anastasia.
- Christian.

94
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,670
Holy cow!

95
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,110
Before you say anything... You're a goddess, this is perfect.

96
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,930
What?

97
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,550
I just got his email, he answered every question.

98
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,880
So? What was he like?

99
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,980
- He was fine.
- Fine? Just fine?

100
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:58,210
He was very polite, and he was curteous, and very formal and clean.

101
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,500
Clean?

102
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,020
I mean, he was very you know, smart.

103
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,770
And intense, kind of intimidating.

104
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,340
- I can understand the fascination.
- Uh huh!

105
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,250
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Like what?

106
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,640
Okay.

107
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,540
I'm gonna make a sandwich, do you want one?

108
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,570
No, thanks.

109
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,760
You have to admit, he's ridiculously hot.

110
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:46,950
I'm sure if you're attracted to that sort of human.

111
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,470
The hot type of human?

112
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,840
I asked him if he was gay. It was in your questions.

113
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Why would you do that to me?

114
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,510
Because whenever he's in the society pages.

115
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,900
He's never been photographed with a woman so naturally.

116
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,570
Well maybe he just wants to keep his private life private, Kate.

117
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,160
- And now you're defending him.
- I'm ending this conversation.

118
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,450
Too bad we don't have any original stills of your

119
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,990
hot, clean, 27 year old billionaire.

120
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,540
The camera loves him as much as you do.

121
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,810
Okay I wasn't hungry, but now I am.

122
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,710
Thank you.

123
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,830
I love you.

124
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,870
- Ana, I've been looking for you.
- Whats up?

125
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,190
- Guess what?
- What?

126
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,120
Portland's place is going to exhibit my photographs next month.

127
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,310
Oh my god!

128
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,940
Congratulations, thats so good!

129
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,460
- It feels so good.
- Can we celebrate later?

130
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,770
Cause I'm really late for work.

131
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,300
Yeah, yeah, you got it, you got it.

132
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,410
- Hold on, hold on, hold on...
- Thank you, you're my hero.

133
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,540
- See you later.
- Okay.

134
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,620
Mom I'm at work, can I call you back?

135
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,490
No wait. I called for a reason.

136
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,860
Bob broke his foot playing golf of all things.

137
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,010
Christ, is he okay? Is he in a lot of pain?

138
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,630
Who knows? The man called the paramedics because of a blister.

139
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,610
It means though, we won't be able to fly in for graduation.

140
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,440
Really? I mean, you could just come alone, you don't have to bring Bob.

141
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,980
Leave "Tiger" Woods to defend for himself?

142
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,220
- You understand, don't you darling?
- Yeah, yeah its fine.

143
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,420
- I really have to go, okay?
- I love you, Ana.

144
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,030
I know, I love you too.

145
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,310
God.

146
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:24,840
- Ana! Can you give me a hand out back?
- Uh yeah yeah, I'll be right there.

147
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,460
- Thought it was you.
- What the...?

148
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,840
What a pleasant surprise. Miss Steele.

149
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:45,220
It's Ana, just Ana. You're in here...

150
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,060
I was in the area on business, needed to pick up a few things.

151
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,780
- Are you free?
- Yeah. What can I help you with?

152
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,810
Do you stock cable ties?

153
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,500
Cable ties, yes we do, I can show you if you want.

154
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,490
- Please, lead the way, Miss Steele.
- Its Ana.

155
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,490
- That it?
- Masking tape.

156
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,830
- Are you redecorating?
- No.

157
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,650
We have two inch and one inch, but the truly self respecting handyman

158
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,310
would have both in his tool box.

159
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,940
Of course he will.

160
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,450
It's rare to find a connoisseur these days...

161
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,190
- Do you want anything else?
- Yes, rope.

162
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,960
That's very impressive. You're girl scout?

163
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,030
No, organised group activity aren't really my thing.

164
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,290
- So what is your thing?
- I don't know... Books?

165
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:06,660
Okay, rope, tape, cable ties. You're like a complete serial killer.

166
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,380
- Not today.
- Anything else?

167
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,750
- What would you recommend?
- For a do-it-yourself er?

168
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,820
Maybe coveralls, to protect all your clothes?

169
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,620
- Or I could just take all my clothes off.
- Okay, no clothes.

170
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:31,410
I mean, no coveralls. I can't ever think of anything else.

171
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,890
- Well, I guess that's it then.
- Cool.

172
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,160
Thank you for answering Kate's questions by the way.

173
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,340
- She was thrilled.
- I hope she's feeling better.

174
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,400
She is. Yeah, much. She's just having a hard time clearing a photo of you again.

175
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,650
If she'd like an original, I'm around tomorrow.

176
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,090
- You'd be willing to do that?
- Yeah.

177
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,140
Do you want me to bag for you, Ana?

178
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,120
No, No, I'm good, thanks though, Paul.

179
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,400
Okay.

180
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,100
I'm staying locally at the Heathman. Call me before 10.

181
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,800
- About the photos.
- Oh, yeah, I will.

182
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,900
Enjoy your...

183
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,900
Thanks again for doing this, Mr Grey.

184
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,080
- I'm happy to help.
- How about we try a few with a smile?

185
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,430
Or... or not.

186
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,390
You do realise he hasn't stopped looking at you?

187
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,850
He asked me to go for a coffee afterwards.

188
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
What?

189
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,150
Kate, shh...

190
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,290
So is he your boyfriend?

191
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,380
- Who?
- The photographer.

192
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,160
- Jose? No.
- I saw the way he was smiling at you.

193
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,770
No, Jose is more like family. He's not my boyfriend.

194
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,150
- And the guy at the store?
- Paul? No.

195
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,590
Thank you.

196
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,310
- You seem nervous.
- I find you intimidating.

197
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,940
You should.

198
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,520
- Eat.
- Not to mention high-handed.

199
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm used to getting my own way.

200
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,340
That must get very boring.

201
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,400
- Tell me about your family.
- My family? Uh... Okay.

202
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,260
My dad died when I was a baby.

203
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,930
So I was raised by my step-father, Ray.

204
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,920
- He's amazing.
- And your mother?

205
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,090
My mother is on husband number four.

206
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,740
She's an incurable romantic.

207
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,180
- Are you?
- Am I romantic?

208
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,770
Well, I study English Lit. So I kind of have to be.

209
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,580
I thought the photo shoot went well, right? Kate seems to be really happy.

210
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,890
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- What?

211
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,320
I'll walk you out.

212
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,630
- Do you have a girlfriend, is that it?
- I don't do the girlfriend thing.

213
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,820
- What does that even mean?
- Watch it!

214
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,990
I'm not the man for you. You should steer clear of me.

215
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,570
I have to let you go.

216
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,260
Goodbye, Mr Grey.

217
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,300
Alright, pencils down.

218
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,150
Please take your final exams to the back of the classroom.

219
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,420
Final grades will be posted in two weeks.

220
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,190
- Hey, you all good?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

221
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,720
- We are so partying tonight!
- Oh my god.

222
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,680
This is way too much.

223
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,550
No, we're getting exactly the right amount.

224
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,850
- All over my face?
- That's the idea.

225
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,680
- Wow, no, Kate.
- Cab's early, let's go.

226
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,040
Ana, there's a package for you.

227
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,360
Why didn't you tell me there was danger? Why didn't you warn me?

228
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,780
Ladies know what to guard against

229
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,530
because they read novels that tells them of these tricks.

230
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,760
That's a quote from Tess of the d'Urberville.

231
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,060
Oh my god.

232
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,860
These must be from Christian.

233
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,080
I mean...

234
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,140
These are incredible.

235
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,930
Wow, Grey.

236
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:37,040
Kate, these are first editions. I can't, this is too much.

237
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,140
I can't accept these, I have to send them back.

238
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,880
That's the cab, okay, are you ready?

239
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,080
- Are you really, though?
- Yes, yes, very.

240
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,280
Let's get outta here.

241
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,860
Shots! Shots! Shots!

242
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,830
No holding back here girl!

243
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,270
- Did you do it all?
- Alright!

244
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,550
With my right eye closed and left handed, I can get this in.

245
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,580
- What?
- I gotta pee.

246
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,050
- Okay.
- One, two...

247
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,230
- Where you going?
- I gotta go pee.

248
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,890
Christian Grey.

249
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,420
- Anastasia.
- Yep, this is me.

250
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,640
Sending back your expensive books,

251
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,300
cause I already have hard copies of that.

252
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,960
Thanks though, for the kind gesture.

253
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,750
You're welcome. Where are you?

254
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,430
Oh? I'm in line, cause I have to pee really bad.

255
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,570
Anastasia, have you been drinking?

256
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,690
Yeah, I have, Mr Fancy Pants.

257
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,240
You hit the nail on the head.

258
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,370
I mean the head right on the nail.

259
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,400
Listen to me, I want you to go home right now.

260
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,520
You're so bossy.

261
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:22,070
"Ana, lets go for coffee", "Ana, lets go for coffee."

262
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,680
"No stay away from me Ana, I don't want you, get away."

263
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,960
"Come here, come here." "Go away."

264
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,780
Thats it.

265
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,120
- Tell me where you are.
- I'm a long way from Seattle.

266
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,150
- Long way from you.
- Which bar, whats it called?

267
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,660
- I don't know, I gotta go.
- Which bar, Ana?

268
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,370
I told him right?

269
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,050
Christian Grey.

270
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,140
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

271
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,510
Stay where you are, I'm coming to get you.

272
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,650
What? Hello?

273
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,420
- Hey.
- Oh thanks.

274
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,130
Are you okay?

275
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,250
Yes, I just feel a little more drunk than...

276
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,640
- Come here, stay warm.
- Oh thats cool, I'm good, Jose.

277
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,260
No, I wanna have the courage to do this.

278
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,350
Do what?

279
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,320
- Ana, I like you.
- You do?

280
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,910
- Very much.
- Oh my god.

281
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,830
- No, no, no.
- Please, one kiss.

282
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,240
No, no, no. Jose, I'm sorry, no.

283
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,730
- Dude, she said no.
- Christian?

284
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,210
- Don't look at me.
- Here.

285
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:08,310
Nice touch, I will launder this item.

286
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,730
- Lets get you home.
- I'm with Kate.

287
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,030
- I'll have Elliot tell her.
- Who's Elliot?

288
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,330
He's my brother, he's inside talking to her right now.

289
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,470
- I, I don't...
- He's at my hotel with me.

290
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,460
- You're still at the Heathman?
- Yes. Come.

291
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,440
- Thats your brother?
- Not by choice, let's go.

292
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,220
Wait, what did Kate say?

293
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,980
She warned me to be on my best behaviour.

294
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,770
- More like threatened me.
- She threatened you?

295
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,700
You're spinning. I think I'm gonna faint.

296
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,730
What, now?

297
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,640
Eat me, drink me.

298
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,850
Good morning, Anastasia.

299
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,180
- How you feeling?
- Better than I deserve.

300
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,670
Did you put me to bed?

301
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,540
- You undressed me?
- I didn't have much choice.

302
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,180
Where did you sleep?

303
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,140
Oh my god... Did we? We didn't...

304
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,370
Necrophillia's not my thing.

305
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,380
- So we just slept then?
- It was a novelty for me too.

306
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:44,190
You... need to eat. I had Taylor pick you up some clothes.

307
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,070
- Who's Taylor?
- My driver.

308
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,020
Thanks, but you didn't have to do that.

309
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,380
Yes I did.

310
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,340
Yours were covered in vomit.

311
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,570
You shouldn't have drunk like that.

312
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,440
I'm all for testing the limits but...

313
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,930
- you put yourself at risk last night.
- I know.

314
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,040
If you were mine, you wouldn't be able to sit down for a week.

315
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,080
What?

316
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,060
I gotta go take a shower.

317
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,850
Why am I here, Christian?

318
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,540
You're here because I'm incapable of leaving you alone.

319
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Then don't.

320
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,540
- Why'd you send me those books?
- I thought I owed you an apology.

321
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,420
- For what?
- For letting you believe that I...

322
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:02,660
Listen to me. I don't do romance.

323
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:12,730
My tastes are very... singular. You wouldn't understand.

324
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,650
Enlighten me then.

325
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,850
- You look beautiful.
- Taylor has good taste.

326
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,860
- What are you doing here later?
- I'm working at the hardware store till 7.

327
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,230
I'll have Taylor pick you up then.

328
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,180
I'd like to bite that lip.

329
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,040
I think I'd like that.

330
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,810
I'm not gonna touch you, not until I have your written consent.

331
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,030
What?

332
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,130
I'll explain later. Come, I'll take you home.

333
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,200
Fuck the paperwork.

334
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,860
What is it about elevators?

335
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,170
Hey!

336
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,390
- Hi, you must be Ana.
- You must be Elliot.

337
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,070
And we must be going, Elliot.

338
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,010
So awesome to meet your. Kate's told me a lot about you.

339
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,100
Elliot, find your shoes, some of us have work to return to.

340
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,330
What you're doing with Mr Worm here, I've got no idea.

341
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,770
Laters baby.

342
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,840
I'll see you tonight, email me if something changes.

343
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,420
My computer's broken.

344
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,040
Well call then, you know you have my number.

345
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,220
Laters, baby.

346
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,060
- Elliot seems really nice.
- No, no. We're starting with you.

347
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,410
If you're seeing him again tonight, this means that something happened.

348
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,630
- Ana? Tell me what happened...
- I have to get ready for work.

349
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,810
We just kissed. Once.

350
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,280
Only once? Thats odd.

351
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,980
- Odd doesn't even cover it.
- Uh huh, and a new jacket.

352
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,770
Bye.

353
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,610
Hi, its Taylor right?

354
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:02,020
Good evening, Miss Steele, Mr Grey will be joining us there.

355
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,880
Good evening, Anastasia.

356
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,600
What, you're flying this?

357
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,590
No escaping now.

358
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,600
November 1-2-2-4. Charlie Tango. Ready to depart.

359
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,280
Charlie tango, your flight plan to Seattle has been cleared.

360
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,950
Seattle? Thats where we're going?

361
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,600
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes please.

362
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,760
- You play?
- Yes.

363
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,190
Of course you do.

364
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,910
- Whats this?
- Its a nondisclosure agreement.

365
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,170
It means you cannot discuss anything about us with anyone.

366
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,480
I'm afraid my lawyer insists on it.

367
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,120
I would never talk to anyone about us anyway.

368
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,100
Are you gonna make love to me now?

369
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,550
Two things: First, I don't make love.

370
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,620
I fuck hard.

371
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,530
- And the second?
- Come.

372
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,350
- Its just behind this door.
- What is it?

373
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,420
- My playroom.
- Like your xbox and stuff?

374
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,380
Its important you know that you can leave at any time.

375
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,780
Why, what's in there?

376
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,290
I meant what I said, the helicopter

377
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,250
is standby, for whenever you wanna go.

378
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,070
Christian, Just open the door.

379
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,350
Oh my god.

380
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,650
Its called a flogger.

381
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,060
Say something please.

382
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,130
Do women do this to you or...

383
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,850
I do this to women. With women.

384
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,560
Women who want me to.

385
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:02,880
- You're a sadist?
- I'm a dominant.

386
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,260
What does that mean?

387
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,140
It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself to me.

388
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,780
Why would I do that?

389
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:15,630
- To please me.
- Please you? How?

390
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:19,810
I have rules, if you follow them, I'll reward you.

391
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,560
If you don't, I'll punish you.

392
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,180
You'd punish me, you'd use this stuff on me?

393
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,570
- Yes.
- What would I get out of this?

394
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,790
Me.

395
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:54,160
If we were to do this, this would be your room.

396
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,310
You can decorate it however you like.

397
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,690
You want me to move in?

398
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,810
Not full time, just Friday through to Sunday.

399
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,700
We can negotiate the particulars.

400
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,080
So, I'd sleep in here with you?

401
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:16,070
No I sleep downstairs. I told you, I don't sleep with anyone.

402
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,080
What if I don't want anything to do with that?

403
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,950
Then I understand completely.

404
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,270
But then we wouldn't have any sort of relationship at all?

405
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,970
This is the only sort of relationship I have.

406
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:36,180
- Why?
- It's the way I am.

407
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:48,470
When you said negotiate, what did you mean?

408
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,190
I already have the contract prepared. It's fairly detailed.

409
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,250
You will review it, and we'll negotiate what you are and not willing to try.

410
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,730
How can I know what I'd be willing to try?

411
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,660
Well, when you had sex, was there anything you didn't like doing?

412
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,020
We have to be honest with each other for this to work,

413
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,050
Okay?

414
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:29,440
- Because I haven't...
- You're still a virgin?

415
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,160
I've just shown you...

416
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,560
I know, I just...

417
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,820
- You've done other things, right?
- No.

418
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,850
- Where have you been?
- Waiting.

419
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,250
Guys must throw themselves at you.

420
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,500
They're never what I've wanted.

421
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,850
You are biting your lip.

422
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:21,360
- What are you doing?
- Rectifying the situation.

423
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,910
I am a situation?

424
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,930
You're energetic this morning.

425
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,620
- You hungry?
- Very.

426
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,360
Because I'm making pancakes.

427
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,790
Lets get you cleaned up.

428
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,420
Do you trust me?

429
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,750
Stay here.

430
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:08,820
Hold out your wrists.

431
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,940
Hold them there. Understand?

432
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:35,670
- Tell me you understand.
- I won't move my arms.

433
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,800
Good girl.

434
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,230
- Stay still.
- Okay.

435
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,000
- Say yes.
- To what.

436
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,630
Being mine.

437
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:10,970
Christian!

438
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,440
- Shit. - What? - Its my mother.

439
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,250
- I'm naked.
- Get dressed.

440
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:26,060
No need to show me around, no need to hover.

441
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,910
He's sleeping, Dr. Grey.

442
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,590
Still sleeping? He never sleeps in.

443
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,040
Certainly not at this hour.

444
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,690
Unless of course he's ill is he? Ah.

445
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,220
Sorry Mr. Grey.

446
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,160
Its fine, I know how she can be.

447
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:40,920
She? Darling you can try to avoid me, but the least you can do is

448
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,230
call me by my correct name, which is mama.

449
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,780
- Hi.
- Oh, dear god.

450
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,490
Mother, Anastasia Steele. Ana, meet my mother.

451
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,080
Dr. Grace, Trevelyan Grey.

452
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,620
You have no idea how delighted I am to meet you.

453
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,820
Its nice to meet you too, Dr. Grey.

454
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,350
Grace. She's very pretty.

455
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,630
You are very pretty.

456
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,650
Thanks.

457
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,850
What happened to calling before dropping by?

458
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,320
And have your head-henchman give me the run around here, no thank you.

459
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:12,290
I'll take my chances. Well I was in the neighbourhood and I thought perhaps

460
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,650
we could have lunch.

461
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,940
I can't today, I have to drive Ana home.

462
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,580
Its okay, take it, I was just showing mother out.

463
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,620
Excuse me.

464
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,280
Anastasia!

465
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,930
- Kate, wait.
- It was a joy to meet you.

466
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,290
I'm having the whole family next week for dinner at my house.

467
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,930
Christian's sister Mia is back from Paris, you must come.

468
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,380
We'll see, mother.

469
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,590
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

470
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:39,730
Kate.

471
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,030
Thank you.

472
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,320
I can't talk about it right now, Kate.

473
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,670
I gotta go, I'll call you back, okay?

474
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,900
Everything okay with the phone call?

475
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,680
Yeah, nothing important. I liked your mom.

476
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,970
She's excited. She's never seen me with a woman before.

477
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,190
You're the first.

478
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,310
What is it, Ana?

479
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:42,320
I just... How many women have stayed in here?

480
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,490
15.

481
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,810
- Thats a lot of women.
- I told you before, if you want out...

482
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:53,540
I don't want out, I just...

483
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,260
I am not exactly jumping at the opportunity

484
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,990
to get your whips, torture and your red room of pain.

485
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:01,320
The red room is much more about pleasure. I promise you.

486
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,870
Will we still go out to dinner, and movies and...

487
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,710
That's not really my thing.

488
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:15,610
Try to keep an open mind.

489
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,310
If you agree to be my submissive, I will be devoted to you.

490
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:29,210
This is what I want. And I want it with you.

491
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:39,430
Why do I have to sleep in here? We slept in the same bed last night.

492
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,190
Like normal people.

493
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,650
Try not to get hung up on the sleeping arrangements.

494
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,300
If you agree to do this, you're gonna want your own room.

495
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,790
Why, because I'll be your sex slave?

496
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,410
I don't wanna do this here, lets talk downstairs.

497
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:58,430
No. I think I'll hold on to my freewill a little while longer, thank you.

498
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:05,170
Actually you know what, I would like to go home, can I go home?

499
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:12,390
- Which one's yours?
- All of them.

500
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,320
Lets go for a walk.

501
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,900
How did you start doing this?

502
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,130
One of my mother's friends.

503
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,380
- I was 15.
- She seduced you?

504
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,360
I was her submissive for six years.

505
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,830
Seriously, does your mother know that?

506
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:29,390
Of course not. No one in my family knows about this.

507
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:31,600
Part of me.

508
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,880
So she introduced you to all of this? Mrs Robinson?

509
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:42,970
Mrs Robinson? I'll tell her you said that.

510
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:43,950
She'll love it.

511
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:50,640
- You still talk to her?
- On occasions. We're friends.

512
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,800
Ana. I know how intimidating this is. I felt the same at first.

513
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:20,540
By giving up control, I felt free, from responsibilities.

514
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,590
From making decisions. I felt safe.

515
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:27,410
You will too, you'll see.

516
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,160
I never took anyone in the helicopter.

517
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,430
Never had sex in my own bed. Never slept with anyone.

518
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,720
Ever. Only you.

519
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,200
This is the contract. Read it carefully.

520
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:17,650
Email me if you have any questions.

521
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:20,060
I told you, my computer's down.

522
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,510
Just consider it okay?

523
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,060
I really hope you say yes.

524
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,810
- Thanks for the ride.
- Laters baby.

525
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,340
- Um.
- Okay, you're all set.

526
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,450
Your roommate let me in.

527
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,920
I just figured you forgot to tell me about it.

528
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,920
- Do I look okay?
- Tell you about what?

529
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,630
- Just sign here.
- Hold on, do you have the right apartment?

530
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,310
Anastasia Steele?

531
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,850
- Enjoy.
- Another gift huh?

532
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:12,390
What happened to flowers and chocolate?

533
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:14,340
I'm dying to hear everything, but

534
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,520
I have to run right now, cause Elliot and I are having dinner.

535
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,060
And then we're seeing a show at the Gorge.

536
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,110
Jose called for you, twice, by the way.

537
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:25,570
- The mailer had come?
- Oh um...

538
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,920
These are my thesis notes, I left them at school.

539
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,150
Oh okay, well there's yesterday's mail.

540
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:44,330
- What?
- I don't know. You look... different.

541
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,520
- I feel different.
- Of course you do.

542
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,920
- Okay.
- Bye.

543
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,110
Bye.

544
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,700
The following are the terms of a binding contract...

545
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:49,220
Between the dominant and the submissive. The fundamental purpose of this contract...

546
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,410
Is to allow the submissive to explore her sensuality, and her limits of safeness.

547
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,430
The dominant and the submissive agree and acknowledge that all that occurs

548
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,120
under the terms of this contract will be consensual,

549
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,060
confidential.

550
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,650
And subject to the agreed limits and safety procedures set out in this contract.

551
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:11,140
The submissive will agree to any

552
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:14,230
sexual activity deemed fit and pleasurable by the dominant,

553
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:17,200
Excepting those activities, outlined in Hard Limits.

554
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,280
So much. Thank you.

555
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:25,240
The Submissive will not drink to excess, smoke, or take recreational drugs,

556
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:28,080
or put her person into any unnecessary risk.

557
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,790
The Submissive will not enter into sexual relations

558
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:34,880
with anyone other than the Dominant.

559
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,380
The Submissive agrees to procure oral contraception

560
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,590
from a physician of the Dominant's choosing.

561
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,550
The Submissive will eat regularly

562
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,300
to maintain her health and well-being

563
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:49,060
from a prescribed list of foods. Appendix Four.

564
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:53,520
The Submissive will obey any instruction given by the Dominant.

565
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,690
She will do so eagerly and without hesitation.

566
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,650
The Submissive may not touch the Dominant

567
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,070
without his expressed permission to do so.

568
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,240
The Submissive shall always conduct herself

569
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,120
in a respectful manner to the Dominant,

570
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,290
And she'll address him only as "Sir," "Mr. Grey..."

571
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,910
or such other title as the Dominant may direct.

572
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:19,880
The Dominant may flog, spank, whip, or corporally punish the Submissive

573
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,090
As he sees fit, for purposes of discipline

574
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,720
Or for his personal enjoyment.

575
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,900
The safe word yellow

576
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:29,000
will be used to bring the attention of the dominant

577
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,420
that the submissive is close to her limit.

578
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,220
When the safe word Red is spoken.

579
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,230
The dominantes actions will cease completely

580
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,020
and immediately.

581
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,800
Submissive.

582
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:44,870
Does the submissive agree to be restrained, with hands bound?

583
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:47,680
Does the submissive consent to being blindfolded?

584
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:50,580
Does the submissive consent to be gagged?

585
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,180
How much pain is the submissive willing to experience?

586
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,530
Christian.

587
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,000
Its been nice knowing me has it?

588
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:53,840
Let me remind you, how nice it was.

589
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,290
Is this what you want?

590
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,580
Don't make a sound.

591
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,140
Was this "nice"?

592
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:34,450
That was really nice.

593
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,140
Mr Christian Grey: Dominant.

594
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,350
Miss Anastasia Steele: Submissive.

595
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:44,360
What are you doing to me?

596
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,270
What about here?

597
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,520
Why not? Is that breaking the rules?

598
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:18,460
- Speaking of which...- I haven't made up my mind yet.

599
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:27,190
- You're not staying?

600
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:32,820
- I told you. I don't sleep with anyone.

601
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,580
Can we negotiate?

602
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,620
Thats a hell of a sack, Miss Steele.

603
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,440
Business meeting.

604
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:39,600
- Impressive.- I've done this before.

605
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:45,740
- Business meetings I mean.
- Oh.

606
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,210
Miss Steele. Your meeting.

607
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:55,460
Page 1... strike out my old address and replace it with the new one.

608
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:57,910
An oversight. Do go on.

609
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,980
Page 3, section 15-20.

610
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,200
"The submissive shall submit to any sexual activity"

611
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:09,890
"... demanded by the dominant without hesitation or argument."

612
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:21,210
Turn to page 5, appendix 3, soft limits.

613
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:25,030
- With you.- Find anal fisting.

614
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,000
- I'm all ears.- Strike it out.

615
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:35,170
Strike out vaginal fisting too.

616
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:37,830
- You sure?
- Yep.

617
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:41,070
Same page.

618
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,810
"Is the use of sex toys acceptable to the submissive."

619
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:46,680
Vibrators... okay, Dildos... fine.

620
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,760
Genital clamps... absolutely not.

621
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:57,090
- Consider them gone.- What are butt plugs?

622
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,640
You must go through quite a few non-disclosure agreements.

623
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,950
My staff know only what I choose to tell them.

624
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,630
Please resume Miss Steele.

625
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:28,570
Also, on page 5, there are some terms which need clarification.

626
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:33,520
- Suspension?
- Hanging on a rope from the ceiling.

627
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:37,720
- For what possible reason?
- For your pleasure.

628
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:43,060
- Really?
- And mine... something to consider.

629
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,610
No. Hard limit.

630
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:51,380
"Is bondage acceptable to the submissive?"... I'm good with rope.

631
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:56,060
Leather casts, hand cuffs... Please lose tape.

632
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:03,360
- And whats others?
- Cable ties?

633
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,280
Can I just say how impressed I am with your commitment to this meeting?

634
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:15,760
And in that spirit, I'm gonna offer something sweeter.

635
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:22,070
How about, once a week, on a night of your choosing, we go on a date.

636
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:30,160
Just like a regular couple... dinner movie, ice skating.

637
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:35,280
- Whatever you want.
- Accepted.

638
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:40,680
- You're very kind.- I'll suggest it in Appendix 5.

639
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,840
I would like to fuck you into the middle of next week.

640
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:05,670
- You're not fighting fair.- I never have.

641
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:12,060
I'll review all these changes and try to arrive at a decision.

642
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:15,180
- You wanna leave?
- Yes.

643
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:20,700
But your body tells me something different. Your legs for instance.

644
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,760
The way you're pressing your thighs together under the table.

645
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:31,900
The change in your breathing. And then your complexion.

646
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:34,940
- My complexion?
- You're flushed.

647
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,880
- That could just be the wine.- Its the adrenaline.

648
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:53,270
Say I did stay. What would happen?

649
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:58,860
First, I would help you out of that little dress of yours.

650
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,630
- Yes?
- Then I'd be pleased to discover...

651
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:05,660
- that you are naked underneath.- Really?

652
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,740
- Then I would bend you over.- Right here?

653
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,950
- Yes.- On this table?

654
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:18,410
Yes.

655
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,450
Thank you for the meeting, Mr. Grey.

656
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:51,770
This is me.

657
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:56,610
Didn't know I was a collector of classic cars huh?

658
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:01,890
You're sure I can't persuade you to stay?

659
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:03,460
Goodnight, Christian.

660
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:07,520
- When will you know?
- Soon, maybe.

661
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,230
Why do I think you're telling me goodbye?

662
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:21,720
Because I'm leaving.

663
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:31,020
You got your speech ready yet?

664
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,060
More or less.

665
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:34,080
- Annie.
- Dad!

666
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,200
Hi.

667
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:39,800
Sorry I'm late, I had a hell of a time parking.

668
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:41,980
Oh thats okay, you're here, that's all that matters.

669
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,460
You're kidding me, I wouldn't miss this for the world.

670
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,740
I saved you a seat next to Kate's parents, okay?

671
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:47,260
- I'll sit where you want, Miss Steele.
- Okay. I'll see you after.

672
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,010
Yeah, good luck out there.

673
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:52,290
And is also a major benefactor for our university.

674
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:56,360
Please join me in welcoming, Mr Christian Grey.

675
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:16,780
Thank you. I am deeply moved by the great compliment accorded to me today.

676
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:21,810
- He is so hot.
- Oh god. He so is.

677
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:26,290
I heard he's gay.

678
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,960
Sustainable methods of farming for third world countries.

679
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:35,090
The goal? To eradicate hunger and poverty across the globe.

680
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:43,920
I myself have known what its like to be profoundly hungry.

681
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,610
So this is a very personal mission for me.

682
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:58,150
Anastasia Steele.

683
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:01,140
Thanks.

684
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:07,340
Congratulations, you must be very proud.

685
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,750
I am. Nice tie by the way?

686
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,960
Truthfully its become my favourite.

687
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:15,690
- Do you have your answer yet?
- I'm still thinking.

688
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:18,610
Anastasia, just try it my way. Please.

689
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,460
- Okay.
- What?

690
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:27,070
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

691
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,170
- Dad, hi!
- I am so proud of you, Annie.

692
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,230
Thank you.

693
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:38,430
Oh, Kate. Best speech of all others.

694
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:39,630
- Thanks.
- Of course.

695
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,790
Yeah, I agree.

696
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:42,850
- Ana? Hi.
- Hi.

697
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:45,930
Ray, have you met Christian Grey? Ana's new boyfriend?

698
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:46,960
Hi.

699
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:48,630
Great pleasure to meet you.

700
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,150
My pleasure. I really enjoyed your speech.

701
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:50,910
Thank you, sir.

702
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:53,110
Sounds like you've accomplished some pretty impressive things.

703
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,020
And what things?

704
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:57,030
- Thank you.
- Okay, I'm gonna go find my family,

705
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,880
who are impatiently waiting to embarrass me. Bye.

706
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,880
- Visit us soon, yeah?
- Soon as I get an invitation.

707
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,270
So, how long you two known each other?

708
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:08,320
A few weeks now, we actually met when Anastasia

709
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,490
interviewed me for the student newspaper.

710
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:12,800
- A picture please Mr. Grey?
- One minute excuse me.

711
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,290
Big smile now.

712
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:50,390
To celebrate your graduation. Among other things.

713
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:57,310
Roll your eyes at me again, and I will take you across my knee.

714
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:04,380
So it begins.

715
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:11,240
- Come on, I've got something to show you.
- What?

716
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:24,650
Thats cute. Doesn't really seem like your style though.

717
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:31,120
It's not, happy graduation, Anastasia.

718
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:35,170
Oh my god. Christian, thats a car.

719
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,220
You don't miss much, do you?

720
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,440
Thank you but I can't. This is too...

721
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:45,460
- Do you like it?
- Of course I like it, its beautiful.

722
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:52,040
But I have a car... Where's my car?

723
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,210
I told Taylor to fetch a decent price for it.

724
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,180
Christian, this is way too much.

725
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:57,770
Did you just roll your eyes at me?

726
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:07,890
Do you know why I'm doing this?

727
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:09,210
Because I rolled my eyes at you.

728
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,770
And is that polite?

729
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,320
No.

730
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:16,110
- Excuse me?
- No, sir.

731
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:37,920
- Do you want more?
- Yes. Yes.

732
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,960
Welcome to my world.

733
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:12,310
- What are you doing?
- There a few things at the office

734
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:14,660
which require my attention.

735
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,260
You okay?

736
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:22,530
- I just thought that...
- I enjoyed tonight.

737
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,340
I'll see you at my place tomorrow.

738
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:58,420
Hi, mama.

739
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:02,630
Anastasia? Whats going on, I've left you two messages this week.

740
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:07,990
I know I'm sorry. I just got a little distracted.

741
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:11,370
I'm sorry I missed your graduation honey, I heard it was lovely.

742
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,230
And your new beau.

743
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,910
Ray told me all about him, he sounds such a young man.

744
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:20,940
Of course, I would've preferred to have heard about it from you.

745
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:26,200
Ana?

746
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:28,610
Whats the matter?

747
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,610
Nothing, I'm fine.

748
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:34,080
Is he not making you happy?

749
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:38,340
He is yeah, I mean most of the time, yeah.

750
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:40,810
Its complicated.

751
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,510
Listen honey, if you need a break, you just

752
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:49,240
come on right down here.

753
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:51,060
Even if its just for a day or two.

754
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:53,930
I have air miles, and we could talk and have girl time.

755
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,310
Promise me you'll think about it?

756
01:21:58,310 --> 01:22:01,330
Yeah I promise. I promise.

757
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,910
- I love you mama.
- I love you too darling.

758
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:10,430
I gotta go. Bye.

759
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:21,060
Looks like you and Grey did some celebration last night.

760
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:26,500
- Is he still asleep?
- No, he couldn't stay.

761
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:28,900
Well whose car keys are those then?

762
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:35,900
- Those are my keys.
- Wow Ana.

763
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,020
What?

764
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,680
Nothing, I'm just...

765
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,800
Make sure you're taking it at your own pace okay?

766
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:46,240
I am, I am, I gotta go.

767
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:47,610
Where are you going?

768
01:22:55,510 --> 01:23:00,310
- Look at this.
- I've seen it, not a bad picture.

769
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:02,910
Christian Grey and friend.

770
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:05,360
So we're friends.

771
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:08,140
Well it must be true, if its in the paper.

772
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:12,580
- So how did it go with Dr. Greene?
- It was fine.

773
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,770
But she said I had to abstain from

774
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:17,160
all sexual activity for four weeks.

775
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:18,950
You know, after I start the pill.

776
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:19,960
What?

777
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:24,110
Just kidding.

778
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:41,370
I wanna take you to my playroom.

779
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:46,630
I haven't signed the contract.

780
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:49,910
I'm well aware. Call it due diligence.

781
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,300
Okay.

782
01:23:58,290 --> 01:23:59,420
Ready?

783
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:39,140
Eyes down. Take off your shoes.

784
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:44,780
Arms above your head.

785
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,350
You have a beautiful body, Anastasia.

786
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,270
I want you unashamed of your nakedness, understand?

787
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,200
Yes sir.

788
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:09,720
You're biting your lip, you know what it does to me. Turn around.

789
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:21,870
When I tell you to come into this room. This is how you'll be.

790
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,020
You'll wait for me.

791
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:28,060
Kneeling by the door.

792
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:43,590
Hands flat on your thighs. Good.

793
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,310
Hold out your hands.

794
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:47,350
- Did that hurt?
- No.

795
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:50,780
You see? Much of your fear is in your head.

796
01:26:52,470 --> 01:26:53,600
Come.

797
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:16,260
- How does that feel?
- Good, sir.

798
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:38,320
Quiet.

799
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:15,520
Where are we going?

800
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:22,380
Remember my mother mentioned dinner?

801
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:24,560
My sister Mia's in town.

802
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:26,350
Yes.

803
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,500
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah.

804
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,120
Dance with me.

805
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:25,710
- Good evening, Mr. Grey.
- Hi.

806
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:26,740
They're here!

807
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:28,130
You're here.

808
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:31,250
- Welcome welcome.
- Ana, you've met my mother.

809
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:32,200
Hi, lovely to see you.

810
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,420
- This is my father, Carrick.
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.

811
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:35,400
Pleasure to meet you.

812
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:35,970
Is she here?

813
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,570
There's been a lot of speculation!

814
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:39,700
Oh my god! She exists!

815
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,760
Its a great apartment, and the rent's not ridiculous.

816
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:45,980
Elliot and Jose helped us move in.

817
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:48,290
Jose is Ana's friend,

818
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:50,970
although I think Elliot's trying to poach him.

819
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:54,400
He's a cool guy!

820
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,570
Ana, where is your family from?

821
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:01,170
My step father's in Montesano and my mom lives in Georgia.

822
01:33:01,230 --> 01:33:03,580
- Georgia? Which part?
- Savannah.

823
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:08,750
How nice! Although I hear it gets really humid in Georgia this time of year.

824
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:12,260
Oh my god it does. Its stifling sometimes.

825
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:14,190
Actually I'm going to visit her tomorrow.

826
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:17,700
How nice. You hear that Christian?

827
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:20,890
Some children do visit their parents now and again.

828
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:25,240
Hey dad, you catch the Mariners game?

829
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,260
I heard it went back stream.

830
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:28,260
Ugh. Seattle baseball...

831
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:30,860
This is news to me.

832
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:33,020
When were you gonna tell me?

833
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,360
Who wants coffee?

834
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:38,660
Actually I promised Ana a tour of the grounds.

835
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:40,450
Excuse us.

836
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:48,550
Christian, I cannot walk that fast in these shoes.

837
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:54,010
When were you gonna tell me about Georgia?

838
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,870
What? You have no right to be mad at me.

839
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:59,090
Yeah but I am mad. Palm-twitchingly mad.

840
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,690
You're mine. All mine. Understand?

841
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:16,110
Christian, you're so confusing.

842
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,120
- Ana.
- What do you want?

843
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,330
- What do you want?
- I want you.

844
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:28,890
I'm trying, Christian.

845
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:35,340
I know you are.

846
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:38,440
Why can't we sleep in the same bed?

847
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:43,780
Why won't you let me touch you? Why does it have to be like this?

848
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,200
If you would just sign the contract, you wouldn't have...

849
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:55,390
Why do you care so much about the contract, Christian?

850
01:34:55,410 --> 01:34:59,380
- Don't you like me the way I am?
- Of course I do.

851
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:03,130
- Then why are you trying to change me?
- I'm not.

852
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:08,300
- Its you...
- I need more, I want more.

853
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:14,010
Hearts and flowers? That's not something I know.

854
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:21,820
Ana please... Its you that is changing me.

855
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:27,730
Let me touch you. Let me.

856
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:46,770
- Are they burns?
- I had a rough start in life.

857
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:52,090
- That's all you need to know.- Okay.

858
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:19,900
The woman who gave birth to me, was a crack addict.

859
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:22,420
And a prostitute.

860
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:29,250
She died when I was four.

861
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:39,880
I remember certain things. Terrible things.

862
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:45,690
I don't remember her.

863
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:55,470
Sometimes, I can see her in my dreams.

864
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,220
Do you really have to go to Georgia?

865
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,360
Yeah, I really.

866
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,300
Good morning. 12-H is down to your right.

867
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,130
Good morning. 2-B, oh it's just right here.

868
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,510
Oh! No, I'm supposed to be in coach.

869
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,220
Oh, you must have been upgraded.

870
01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:41,560
Good morning. 12-A just down to your right.

871
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:43,350
Good morning.

872
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:34,680
- This gazpacho is really salty, Bob.
- Yeah.

873
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:37,300
You'll get fat with all this sitting around. You tell him, Ana.

874
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,950
Now could you hand me some chips for my bowl of salsa?

875
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:48,400
You can have a carrot?

876
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:51,530
What are you getting at with this?

877
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:56,050
You're lucky that I happen to love you very much.

878
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,020
- I know that.
- Do you?

879
01:38:58,050 --> 01:38:59,100
Hmm, I do.

880
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:37,960
Oh darling, I think we should pace ourselves,

881
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:39,440
or at least order something to eat.

882
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:41,680
You go ahead, I'm not very hungry.

883
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:44,090
Oh, I just have the fruit salad.

884
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:52,870
- He can wait.
- Mom.

885
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:55,290
ANOTHER COSMO?

886
01:40:56,270 --> 01:40:57,850
- Holy fuck.
- What?

887
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,400
What is it?

888
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:04,340
Its Christian, he's here, in Georgia.

889
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:09,550
- Here, here!
- Mrs Adams,

890
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:10,880
delighted to meet you.

891
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:13,510
- Something to drink sir?
- Gin and tonic.

892
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:16,080
Hendrix if you have it, otherwise Bombay Sapphire.

893
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:18,630
Cucumber with the Hendricks, lime with Bombay.

894
01:41:18,650 --> 01:41:20,240
I like him already.

895
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,100
What are you doing here, Christian?

896
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:25,460
- I came to see you.
- I need to go to the bathroom.

897
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:38,770
I broke rule 7, clause 5.

898
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:46,130
We'll let it go, lets not talk about the contract right now.

899
01:41:46,730 --> 01:41:48,190
How was your dinner?

900
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:54,670
She's a friend, thats all.

901
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:57,560
She's a child abuser.

902
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:59,070
I confide in her.

903
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:00,290
She knows me.

904
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:06,090
- What did she advise you to do?
- Well, I'm here.

905
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:12,380
- Now what?
- I've got a room in this hotel.

906
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,160
Well, I hope you'll be comfortable in it.

907
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:23,220
What are you doing for breakfast tomorrow?

908
01:42:28,890 --> 01:42:31,890
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

909
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,130
I think I've reached my quota of surprises.

910
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:37,980
We're almost there.

911
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,570
Mr Grey. Hey, I'll be your co-pilot.

912
01:42:48,590 --> 01:42:51,210
How do you do? This is my girlfriend, Anastasia Steele.

913
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:25,160
We're at 400 feet, ready?

914
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:28,510
- Ready?
- Yes, ready.

915
01:43:28,730 --> 01:43:30,100
Release.

916
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:00,820
Hold on tight.

917
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:06,700
- Is this more?
- Oh my god. So much more!

918
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:32,160
Oh my god, that was incredible, Christian. Thank you.

919
01:44:32,290 --> 01:44:34,190
We aim to please, Miss Steele.

920
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:40,530
- I thought you didn't do romance.
- I don't. Ana.

921
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,010
What? What? Why are you fighting this?

922
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:49,830
What are you afraid of?

923
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:04,800
Grey. What? When?

924
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:10,920
Have Stefan get the plane ready. I'll be on the tarmac in 30 minutes.

925
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:13,820
- What happened?
- I have to go back to Seattle.

926
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:15,560
Come I'll take you home.

927
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:20,080
Oh sweetheart, I wish Christian could've stayed.

928
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,810
Bob was looking forward to meeting him.

929
01:45:22,830 --> 01:45:27,750
I know, he had to get back to Seattle though. There's a um, situation at work.

930
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:31,310
I wish I could tell you things get easier, but they don't.

931
01:45:31,330 --> 01:45:34,330
You just need to get to know yourself better.

932
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:38,530
- Thank you for everything, mama.
- Take care, sweetheart.

933
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:39,570
I will.

934
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:02,600
You think I wouldn't recognise you, Taylor?

935
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:04,110
Right this way, Miss Steele.

936
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:14,140
- How does he seem today, Taylor?
- Preoccupied I'm afraid.

937
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:17,420
- Really?
- Yes ma'am.

938
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:25,100
Well, that's not gonna work.

939
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,550
What?

940
01:46:30,570 --> 01:46:36,080
Well tell them they don't have 24 hours. That is unnacceptable.

941
01:46:36,110 --> 01:46:39,460
I need to know. Just keep me informed.

942
01:46:55,760 --> 01:47:01,340
- Is everything okay?
- Nothing that concerns you.

943
01:47:03,410 --> 01:47:05,800
- I can leave if you want me to go?
- No.

944
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:09,250
Thats the last thing I want.

945
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:20,080
I want you, in the playroom, in 15 minutes.

946
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:51,700
- What are your safe words?
- Red and yellow.

947
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:53,220
Remember them.

948
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:07,090
That sounds so sad. Everything you played is so sad.

949
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:10,900
You said you were six when you learn

950
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,750
with it, because you wanted to please your new family?

951
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,010
I just wanna talk.

952
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:30,050
Why won't you let me in?

953
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:35,160
- We should be talking.
- Like normal people?

954
01:50:35,550 --> 01:50:36,640
Yeah.

955
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:41,780
Is that so wrong?

956
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:57,390
Is this because of the contract? Because I still haven't signed it?

957
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:02,240
Fuck the contract, I think its a little redundant, don't you?

958
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,830
So then the rules are redundant too?

959
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:09,770
- No. The rules stand.
- And what if I break them?

960
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:12,640
- Then there'll be consequences.
- Punishment?

961
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:14,140
Yes.

962
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:17,590
- Why do you want to punish me?
- Ana.

963
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:19,590
Why do you want to hurt me?

964
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:25,530
I would never do anything to you, that you couldn't handle.

965
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:28,540
But why do you even wanna do anything at all to me, Christian?

966
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,780
If I told you, you'd never look at me the same way again.

967
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:38,230
So there is a reason. Tell me.

968
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,710
- Do you wanna punish me right now?
- Yes.

969
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:45,060
I wanna punish you right now.

970
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:50,550
What if I told you that I feel the same way about being punished as you

971
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:53,180
do about me touching you, would you still wanna punish me then?

972
01:51:55,830 --> 01:51:59,130
No. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't need to.

973
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:01,180
- Why?
- Ana stop.

974
01:52:01,210 --> 01:52:03,780
- Why do you need...
- Because it's the way I am!

975
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:14,060
Because I'm 50 shades of fucked up.

976
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:38,660
Show me then.

977
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:57,780
I need you to show me, what you wanna do to me.

978
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:00,950
Punish me, show me how bad it can be.

979
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:02,810
I want you to show me the worst.

980
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,730
It's the only way I can understand.

981
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:30,040
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

982
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:48,290
Bend over.

983
01:53:57,670 --> 01:54:01,540
I'm gonna hit you six times. And you're gonna count with me.

984
01:54:14,010 --> 01:54:18,340
- Count, Anastasia.
- One.

985
01:54:24,210 --> 01:54:25,440
Two.

986
01:54:34,130 --> 01:54:35,130
Three.

987
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:47,280
Four.

988
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:56,060
Five.

989
01:55:09,930 --> 01:55:11,090
Six.

990
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:25,750
No! Don't fucking touch me.

991
01:55:30,130 --> 01:55:34,000
Is this what you really want? You wanna see me like this?

992
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:37,320
- Ana.
- Don't come near me.

993
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:47,010
Does this give you pleasure?

994
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:51,300
No.

995
01:55:56,550 --> 01:55:58,430
Don't you dare come near me.

996
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:03,970
Please don't hate me.

997
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:09,250
You will never do that to me again.

998
01:57:18,150 --> 01:57:23,230
- I'm not what you want.
- No, you are everything that I want.

999
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:33,850
I've fallen in love with you.

1000
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:41,670
No. No, Ana. You can't love me.

1001
01:57:55,090 --> 01:57:56,620
I need you to leave.

1002
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,690
Please.

1003
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:03,990
- I'd like my car back.
- Taylor already sold it.

1004
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:08,570
Then I'd like the money he got for it please.

1005
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:11,610
I'll send you a check.

1006
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:13,520
Okay.

1007
01:59:19,510 --> 01:59:21,050
Taylor will take you home.

1008
01:59:38,940 --> 01:59:39,940
Stop.

1009
01:59:40,630 --> 01:59:41,640
No!

1010
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,190
- Ana.
- Christian.

1010
02:00:00,305 --> 02:00:06,933
